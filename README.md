# Diabetes-Prediction
This project builds a web app to predict diabetes using Machine Learning. It uses a Gradient Boosting Classifier to predict diabetes based on user input features like age, BMI, and blood glucose levels. The project covers data preprocessing, model training, and web deployment using Flask for user interaction and prediction.
